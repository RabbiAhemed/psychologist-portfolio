            At first, I had my doubts about online counselling, but I gave it a
            shot and was pleasantly surprised to learn how much it can actually
            aid you. Dr. Sayesta created a wonderfully peaceful, healing
            environment where I felt free to share details with her that I would
            normally feel embarrassed to do so. She offers much-appreciated
            compassion instead of any judgement, followed by advice. She can
            pinpoint the source of my problems and the exercises I can do to
            solve them. I occasionally feel depressed again, but he constantly
            inspires me to get back on the right track. A truly helpful person
            is someone who won't judge you.
