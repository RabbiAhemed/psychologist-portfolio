              Hello, I have completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at
              Delhi University, subsequently pursued graduate training in
              counseling psychology at the AIIMS Delhi, and completed a
              doctorate in clinical psychology at the Adler School of
              Professional Psychology. I have clinical interests and worked with
              children, teens, adults, diagnostic assessment and addictions. I
              use a broad range of cognitive behavioral and insight oriented
              techniques in the psychotherapy and counseling process.
